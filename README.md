# Sunny Cosmetics

This project is a responsive front-end design demo of a fictional Cosmetics company built with [React](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a demo to show my react skills in building front-end applications using latest technologies
for front-end interfaces like [SwiperJs](https://swiperjs.com/react) for the carousel.

If you are a developer feel free to clone the repo and play with the code
